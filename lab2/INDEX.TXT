<!-- Q1.
For this PHP exercise, write a script using the following variables:
$x=80;
$y=20;
 
Use separated print statements to calculate and print the following statements :

The multiplication of 80 and 20 is 1600.
The division of 80 by 20 results 4.
The remainder of 80 after the divison by 20 is 0.
When 20 reduced from 80 the result is 60.
When we add 80 by 20 the result is 100.

ps. When you change the value of variables $x and $ y the output must be dynamically changed. As a hint use variables while preparing the output. -->

<!-- 
Q2.  
Write a script that will visit each character of a string and 
concatenate the characters of the string to form a word  backward.
 At the end, your script must display:

 Yes, a palindrome
    Or
No, your word is not a palindrome.

Palindrome: is a word or sentence that reads the same forward as 
it does backward. Example civic, radar, rotor.
ps. use strlen to find the length of a string.
Restriction: Can not use strrev() function. -->


<!-- 
Q3.
For this PHP exercise, write a script using the following variables:
$x=2;
$exp=20;

The script will display the power of $x starting from 0 up to $exp using the format below:

The power of 2s
20=1
21=2
22=4
23=8
24=16
...
...
...
220=1048576

ps. When you change the value of variables $x and $exp the
 output must be dynamically changed.pow($base,$exponent) function could be used. -->
