Q1. POEM Form
Using the poem about the days Monday-Sunday below, create a form that will return the relevant line in response to the user's choice of day.
For the form it will be good idea to have a drop down list for the days. In order to display the relevant line via PHP; submission could be done to a different php page or a self-calling page could be created.
Ps. For submission via JavaScript; on change event "if(this.value != '0') this.form.submit()" could be used.

On Sunday I need rest.
