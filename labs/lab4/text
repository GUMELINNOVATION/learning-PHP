<!-- Q1. A factorial of any given integer, n , is the product of all positive
  integers between 1 and n inclusive.
So the factorial of 4 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24, and the factorial of 5
 is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120. This
can be expressed recursively as follows:
❑ If n == 0, return 1. (This is the base case)
❑ If n > 0, multiply numbers from n down to 1.

a. Write a  PHP function to display the factorials of the integers up to the
 given value(argument). Any format could be used for displaying.
b. Write the recursive version of the same function to display the factorials
of the integers up to the given value(argument). Any format could be used for displaying. 

Q2. Write a script that uses a recursive function  named “sumEvens” which
 accepts an integer argument to find the summation of all even numbers between 0 
 and the argument that is specified. Assume the input is always a positive integer.

Q3. Write a script which uses a  function  named “countCharacters” that accepts an 
argument as string. This function should count and display the character and the number
 of appearance for that particular character. Function should count as case insensitive. 
 count_chars & substr_count predefined functions cannot be used. 
Hint: Associative arrays will be a good idea.

Example: if my string is “Hello” then the output should be:  H:1
								  E:1
								  L:2
								  O:1

Q4. Write a function to check weather a string is all uppercase or not. Your function
 should return true or false.
